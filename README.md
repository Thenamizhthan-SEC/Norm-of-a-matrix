# Norm of a matrix
## Aim
To write a program to find the 1-norm, 2-norm and infinity norm of the matrix and display the result in two decimal places.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
	1. Get the input matrix using np.array()   
    2. Find the 2-norm of the matrix using np.linalg.norm()
	3. Print the norm of the matrix in two decimal places.
## Program:
```Python

```
## Output:
### 1-Norm of a Matrix

<img width="1241" height="347" alt="(iii) (2)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2480139-9b6c-4d42-8a77-b4e65a8cc047" />

## Result
Thus the program for 1-norm, 2-norm and Infinity norm of a matrix are written and verified.
